MSCI World Index Analysis: Methodology and Approach

Stage 1: Data Collection

To conduct the analysis, data will be collected at quarterly intervals from September 30, 2014, to September 30, 2024. The data requirements include:

All constituents of the MSCI World Index at each quarterly interval.

Share price data for all listed firms in the index.

Industry classification for each firm, based on MSCI industry definitions.

Resource intensity scores for each firm, covering four key environmental metrics:

Water usage

Waste generation

Energy consumption

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions

Geographical and industry weightings of the MSCI World Index.

All tests will be performed for both 3-year and 5-year periods to evaluate consistency and trends over different time horizons.

Stage 2: Calculation of Environmental Resource Efficiency Scores

Step 1: Industry Selection

One industry will be selected first to test and validate the methodology before applying it to all industries.

Step 2: Normalization of Resource Metrics

Since the resource intensity scores provided are already normalized by sales, no additional normalization is required.

Step 3: Calculation of Factor Scores

A. Each resource (water, waste, energy, GHG) will be processed separately.
B. The average factor score for every firm within the selected industry will be calculated.
C. The standard deviation of all firms’ factor scores within the industry will be determined.
D. A Z-score for each firm will be computed using the formula:



Where:

 = firm's resource intensity score

 = industry average resource intensity score

 = standard deviation of the industry’s resource intensity scores

E. Each firm’s Z-score will be inverted by multiplying by -1, ensuring that firms with better environmental efficiency (lower resource usage) have a positive score.
F. This process will be repeated for all four resource metrics, generating four inverted Z-scores per firm.
G. The average of the four inverted Z-scores will be computed to form the firm’s Environmental Resource Efficiency Score (ERE).

Step 4: Handling Missing Data

If a firm lacks data for any of the four resource intensity scores in a given quarter, it will be assigned an ERE score of zero. Firms with a zero score will not be allocated to or away from.

Step 5: Allocation Strategy

A. Firms with positive ERE scores will be allocated towards, while those with negative scores will be allocated away from.
B. Allocation will be performed within industries to ensure sector neutrality.
C. The proportion a firm represents within its industry (index weight) will be used to determine the allocation amount.
D. The sum of allocation changes within each industry will be set to zero, ensuring that industry weights remain unchanged in the final index composition.
E. The allocation process will be repeated for each industry sequentially.

Key Outputs to be Collected

Tracking Error: Measuring the deviation of the strategy from the MSCI World Index, gross of fees.

Performance Comparison:

Strategy vs. MSCI World Index

Strategy vs. Vanguard MSCI World Tracker (gross of fees)

Environmental Footprint:

Resource intensity scores for each resource (Water, Waste, Energy, GHG) in the strategy vs. the MSCI World Index.

Coverage Statistics:

Number of firms reporting each of the four resource intensity metrics per quarter.

Percentage coverage of firms in the dataset with available environmental data.

Factor Score Analysis:

Performance of the strategy based on momentum, size, and value factors.

By following this structured methodology, the study will provide insights into the impact of environmental efficiency on investment allocation and portfolio performance while maintaining industry neutrality.
